                <h3>Project experience</h3>
                <p>CodeFirstGirls - Python & Apps Course (Mar 22 - May 22)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>Took part in a 8 week course sponsored by GCHQ that taught the fundamentals of Python, which led to creating an app and 
                            presenting it to the group on the final week. My project was based on the game top trumps, which used a pokemon API to 
                            populate the data needed to play the game. Some of the concepts learnt and applied to my project were - loops and functions, 
                            APIs, logic, lists, and dictionaries.</p>
                    </ul>

                <p>CodeFirstGirls - Web Development Course (May 22 - Jul 22)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>Currently taking part in a Web Development course sponsored by IPO which teaches me the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and 
                            JavaScript to create an online personal portfolio, as well as GIT for version control. Some of the concepts I will 
                            learn and plan to implement are - data types, loops, conditionals, functions and objects. As well as implementing 
                            frameworks and libraries such as React.</p>
                    </ul>

                <p>Personal Python Projects (Mar 22 - Present)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>Using online resources and courses such as the CFG Python & Apps course to develop my python skills by creating games
